# Binarized Neural Network Metaplasticity

## Project

This repository will hold the code pertaining to Binarized Neural Network. Several papers will be implemented with several datasets available with a will to gather more information about BNN & metaplasticity within neural networks.

## Metaplasticity

The ability of the synapses to change their own plasticity. In other words, the ability of a synapse
to know how important it is the the overall neural network, and to be kept or discarded depending on this
importance. Refered in [1, 2]

## BOP (Binary Optimizer)

One way to train binarized neural network with momentum. Even if interesting from a computational point of view, seems limited for a metaplastic implementation.
